Project 1: https://github.com/NateGoennerSigPort/numbconverter

This is pretty simple converter which can convert numbers between base systems. It was something I played with then I was still in CISC 131 because I quickly became tired converting between Hex and Binary. 
It served mostly as some practice with python and ensuring I fully understood conversions. It works in its current state, but I remember wanting to come back to it and add more functionality
