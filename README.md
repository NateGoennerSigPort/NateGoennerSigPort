Project 1: https://github.com/NateGoennerSigPort/numbconverter

This is pretty simple converter which can convert numbers between base systems. It was something I played with then I was still in CISC 131 because I quickly became tired converting between Hex and Binary. 
It served mostly as some practice with python and ensuring I fully understood conversions. It works in its current state, but I remember wanting to come back to it and add more functionality. 



Project 2: https://github.com/NateGoennerSigPort/personalwebsite

This was my first website ever which I did for a web development class. I had no knowledge of HTML or CSS prior to this. It features a couple different pages containing information about me and a few assignments I have 
completed in my career at St. Thomas. It allows you navigate between pages as well. My knowledge of web pages has grown significantly since the creation of this page.
