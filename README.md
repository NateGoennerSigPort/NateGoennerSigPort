Project 1: https://github.com/NateGoennerSigPort/numbconverter

This is pretty simple converter which can convert numbers between base systems. It was something I played with then I was still in CISC 131 because I quickly became tired converting between Hex and Binary. 
It served mostly as some practice with python and ensuring I fully understood conversions. It works in its current state, but I remember wanting to come back to it and add more functionality. 

Project 2: https://github.com/NateGoennerSigPort/personalwebsite

This was my first website ever which I did for a web development class. I had no knowledge of HTML or CSS prior to this. It features a couple different pages containing information about me and a few assignments I have 
completed in my career at St. Thomas. It allows you navigate between pages as well. My knowledge of web pages has grown significantly since the creation of this page. 


Project 3: https://github.com/NateGoennerSigPort/dynamicwebsite/tree/main

This is another website created for web development which now dynamically populates information from a database. The reason to conceptulize the data like this was to provide a way to easily look throiugh and determine whether there was any significance to sleeping alone. We had hypothosized people who were single would obviously be primarily sleeping alone, but those in some form of relationship would not. We did find this to mostly be true. We also hypothsized the primary reason people within relationships would sleep alone would be because of snoring. This also proved to be true overall. However, we found the impact of sleep quality to not have a clear conclusion. For some, sleeping alone benefited sleep quality and others found sleeping alone to be largely negative. This sort of research is important because we want people to get overall sleep quality for their health. We also need clear ways to visualize data, so this was a good excersice to test how we might frame data in the future 

Project 4: https://github.com/NateGoennerSigPort/LegacyCalc

This is a pretty simple calculator program which does stuff like mean and standard deviation. The cool part about this is that is uses Fortran code. This is an older programming langauge I learned in a legacy coding class alongside COBOL. Newer programs are probably not being made in this langaugages much today but learning them is important to maintain older code already in usage. 

Project 5: https://github.com/NateGoennerSigPort/AlterQuicksort

This pretty much just quicksort with a little twist. I believe we added in aspects of merge sort. We were learning about both sorting algorithms and run times. To this end, we also wanted to provide some test cases and see how much time was taken for sorting. There was a large increase in time the longer the sorted array was.
